# Command Line Application

## `grrs`

A clone for the popular `grep` command that takes in a pattern and a file path to give all of the lines with the occurances.

Right now only default patterns are supported with exact match.

### Example

To run, please use:

```bash
cargo run -- <pattern> <file_path>
```

```bash
cargo run -- main main.rs
```
